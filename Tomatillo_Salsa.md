# Tomatillo Salsa

## Ingredients

- 8 oz. Tomatillos, husked
- 1x Jalapeno pepper
- Cilantro, as much as you like
- 1x Onion, sweet or yellow
- Salt and pepper
- 1-2 tbsp. Apple cider vinegar
- 1x Avocado

## Preparation

Cut the onion in half and soak it in water.

Husk and wash the tomatillos to remove the sticky residue.

Ideally, roast the tomatillos and pepper over a fire *or* you can broil them until nice and brown, maybe slightly burnt.

Blend ingredients together in a blender or food processor.
